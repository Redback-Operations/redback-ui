# About Redback UI

Redback UI is a library of common React components designed to be used across all of Redback's websites and web applications.

Utilising [styled-components](https://styled-components.com/) for theming and styling, Redback UI components are designed to be easily reusable, and are customisable at the top level by wrapping applications in the `RedbackUiThemeProvider` component. (This uses the [ThemeProvider](https://styled-components.com/docs/advanced) from styled-components under the hood.) Simply pass a theme object to the `theme` prop of the `RedbackUiThemeProvider` component to customise the look and feel of all Redback UI components inside it. Example themes are included in Redback UI, but consuming applications can pass their own if it matches the expected structure as found in the [default theme](https://github.com/Redback-Operations/redback-ui/blob/main/src/themes/default.ts).
